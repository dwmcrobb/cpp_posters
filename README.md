# cpp_posters

Some C++ posters I created a couple of years ago.  They're sort of like large cheat sheets.  They are not complete; C++ and
the C++ Standard Library are larger than what can be legibly reproduced on a poster.

The source is LaTeX, using beamer.  I included the PDF and PostScript for those who just want to have them printed at their
favorite print shop.
