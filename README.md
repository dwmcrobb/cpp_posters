# cpp_posters

Some C++ posters I created in 2018.  They're sort of like large cheat
sheets.  They are not complete; a cheasheet for C++ and the C++ Standard
Library would be too large to be legibly reproduced on a poster.

The source is LaTeX, using beamer.  I included the PDF and PostScript
for those who just want to have them printed at their favorite print
shop.
